# TSE Technical Interview

Welcome to TSE's technical interview for the Developer role!

## How to read this file

If the line above starts with `##`, then you're reading raw Markdown syntax. To get nicer formatting:

1. Go to the left sidebar and find the list of files
2. Find `README.md` and right-click it (Windows/Linux) or hold the Control key and click it (Mac)
3. Click "Open Preview"

## Logistics

* You will have **50 minutes** to work on a programming task with multiple parts.
* You can **choose any programming language**, but the task may be easier in some languages than others.
* You **can't run your code**, but you'll still have syntax highlighting and autocomplete.
* You shouldn't need any external documentation.
  * It's okay if you don't remember the exact name of a function (for example), as long as you communicate this with your interviewers, and everyone understands what you mean.
* You can ask clarifying questions anytime.
* If you get stuck, your interviewers can give you hints.
* The questions are designed to be long, with multiple parts, so you aren't expected to finish everything.

## What we're looking for

* **Programming and problem-solving skills**: find a solution to each task, and implement that solution in code.
* **Communication skills**: read the prompt carefully, think out loud to help your interviewers understand your thought process, and pay attention to any hints your interviewers may give you.
* **Code quality**: write well-structured and understandable code.
* **Testing**: ask clarifying questions, consider edge cases, and trace your code out loud to make sure it works.

## Getting started

1. **Tell your interviewer which programming language you want to use.** If you want, you can change your mind once you see the problem.
1. **Open the solution file for your language.** This gives you syntax highlighting and autocompletion.
   1. Go to the left sidebar and find the list of files
   1. Find the solution file for your language (e.g. `solution.py`)
   1. If the language you want isn't there, create a new file with the appropriate extension using the "New File" button at the top of the sidebar
   1. Right-click the file (Windows/Linux) or hold the Control key and click the file (Mac)
   1. Click "Open to the Side" to get a split-screen view
1. If you have any questions right now, let your interviewers know!
1. When you are ready to begin, your interviewers will paste the problem description at the bottom of this README file, and your 50 minute timer will begin.

This will be replaced with the problem description.
